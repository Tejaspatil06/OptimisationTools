# Circular Economy Model

The Circular Economy Model project aims to optimize resource usage and minimize waste in a product lifecycle by leveraging machine learning models for demand forecasting, predictive maintenance, supply chain optimization, and product design optimization.

## Overview

This project provides a Python implementation of a Circular Economy Model, consisting of several machine learning models integrated into a cohesive framework. The key components include:

- *Products:* Representing various items within the circular economy system.
- *Demand Forecasting:* Predicting future demand for products.
- *Predictive Maintenance:* Anticipating maintenance needs for products.
- *Supply Chain Optimization:* Optimizing the supply chain processes.
- *Product Design Optimization:* Enhancing product design for sustainability.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages: numpy, scikit-learn, pandas

## Data Files

Ensure the following training data files are available:

- demand_training_data.csv
- maintenance_training_data.csv
- supply_chain_training_data.csv
- product_design_training_data.csv
